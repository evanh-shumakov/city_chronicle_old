CITY CHRONICLE

Recently I start to learn Symfony, and it's my first pet project with this framework.
For now the whole css and html snippets as well as the whole project style generated by ChatGPT.
And I'm completeley focused on scrutinizing the most essential developer's tools. 

Before to host it publicly, I want to create a minimum viable project.
The first target is a news list public page with information about scheduled power otage for city Kutaisi.
The project should automatically monitor government's web-resources and find the information.
Then translate it in English language and add some extra comments using OpenAI API.
More over before to public the result it should ask me for approvement in its admin panel.


### Instructions

Default admin credential is **email:** owner@mail.com **password:** owner - change them after deploying application.
